Simple game about cow picking up apples written in Ruby and Gosu https://github.com/jlnr/gosu
Inspired by this brilliant Clojure talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ilUe7Re-RA
Notice for MacOSX: Gosu 0.8.x+ relies on the SDL 2 library. I recommend installing Homebrew and then running brew install sdl2 libogg libvorbis.
